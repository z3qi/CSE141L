Hi! 

The top modules are the int2flt.sv, flt2int.sv, and fltflt.sv. The only difference between them is the "problem_top" signal, 
which is "00" for problem 1, "01" for problem 2, and "10" for problem 3. 

The rest of these top modules are the same. 

To run the codes, you have to change the contents of file "mach_code.txt" to each corresponding machine codes.
